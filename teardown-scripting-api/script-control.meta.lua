--- @return string version -- Dot separated string of current version of the game
--- ### Example
--- ```lua
--- function init()
--- 	local v = GetVersion()
--- 	--v is "0.5.0"
--- 	DebugPrint(v)
--- end
--- ```
function GetVersion() end

--- @param version string -- Reference version
--- @return boolean match -- True if current version is at least provided one
--- ### Example
--- ```lua
--- function init()
--- 	if HasVersion("1.5.0") then
--- 		--conditional code that only works on 0.6.0 or above
--- 		DebugPrint("New version")
--- 	else
--- 		--legacy code that works on earlier versions
--- 		DebugPrint("Earlier version")
--- 	end
--- end
--- ```
function HasVersion(version) end

--- Returns running time of this script. If called from update, this returns
--- the simulated time, otherwise it returns wall time.
--- @return number time -- The time in seconds since level was started
--- ### Example
--- ```lua
--- function client.update()
--- 	local t = GetTime()
--- 	DebugPrint(t)
--- end
--- ```
function GetTime() end

--- Returns timestep of the last frame. If called from update, this returns
--- the simulation time step, which is always one 60th of a second (0.0166667).
--- If called from tick or draw it returns the actual time since last frame.
--- @return number dt -- The timestep in seconds
--- ### Example
--- ```lua
--- function client.tick()
--- 	local dt = GetTimeStep()
--- 	DebugPrint("tick dt: " .. dt)
--- end
--- function client.update()
--- 	local dt = GetTimeStep()
--- 	DebugPrint("update dt: " .. dt)
--- end
--- ```
function GetTimeStep() end

--- @param playerId? number -- Player ID. On client, zero means client player. On server, zero means server (host) player.
--- @return string name -- Name of last pressed key, empty if no key is pressed
--- ### Example
--- ```lua
--- function client.tick()
--- 	local name = InputLastPressedKey()
--- 	if string.len(name) > 0 then
--- 		DebugPrint(name)
--- 	end
--- end
--- ```
function InputLastPressedKey(playerId) end

--- @param input string -- The input identifier
--- @param playerId? number -- Player ID. On client, zero means client player. On server, zero means server (host) player.
--- @return boolean pressed -- True if input was pressed during last frame
--- ### Example
--- ```lua
--- function client.tick()
--- 	if InputPressed("interact") then
--- 		DebugPrint("interact")
--- 	end
--- end
--- ```
function InputPressed(input, playerId) end

--- @param input string -- The input identifier
--- @param playerId? number -- Player ID. On client, zero means client player. On server, zero means server (host) player.

--- ### Example
--- ```lua
--- function client.tick()
--- 	if InputReleased("interact") then
--- 		DebugPrint("interact")
--- 	end
--- end
--- ```
function InputReleased(input, playerId) end

--- @param input string -- The input identifier
--- @param playerId? number -- Player ID. On client, zero means client player. On server, zero means server (host) player.
--- @return boolean pressed -- True if input is currently held down
--- ### Example
--- ```lua
--- function client.tick()
--- 	if InputDown("interact") then
--- 		DebugPrint("interact")

--- end
--- ```
function InputDown(input, playerId) end

--- @param input string -- The input identifier
--- @param playerId? number -- Player ID. On client, zero means client player. On server, zero means server (host) player.
--- @return number value -- Depends on input type
--- ### Example
--- ```lua
--- local scrollPos = 0
--- function client.tick()
--- 	scrollPos = scrollPos + InputValue("mousewheel")
--- 	DebugPrint(scrollPos)
--- end
--- ```
function InputValue(input, playerId) end

--- ### CLIENT ONLY
--- All player input is "forgotten" by the game after calling this function
--- ### Example
--- ```lua
--- function client.update()
--- 	-- Prints '2' because InputClear() allows the game to "forget" the player's input
--- 	if InputDown("interact") then
---     	InputClear()
--- 		if InputDown("interact") then
--- 			DebugPrint(1)
--- 		else
--- 			DebugPrint(2)
--- 		end
--- 	end
--- end
--- ```
function InputClear() end

--- ### CLIENT ONLY
--- This function will reset everything we need to reset during state transition
--- ### Example
--- ```lua
--- function update()
--- 	if InputDown("interact") then
---     	-- In this form, you won't be able to notice the result of the function; you need a specific context
--- 		InputResetOnTransition()
--- 	end
--- end
--- ```
function InputResetOnTransition() end

--- Returns the last input device id.
--- 0 - none, 1 - mouse, 2 - gamepad

--- 	elseif LastInputDevice() == UI_DEVICE_MOUSE then
--- 		DebugPrint("Last input was mouse & keyboard")

--- 		DebugPrint("Last input was touchscreen")
--- 	end
--- end
--- ```
function LastInputDevice() end

--- ### Example
--- ```lua
--- myValue = 0
--- function client.tick()
--- 	--This will change the value of myValue from 0 to 1 in a linear fasion over 0.5 seconds
--- 	SetValue("myValue", 1, "linear", 0.5)
--- 	DebugPrint(myValue)
--- end
--- ```
function SetValue(variable, value, transition, time) end

--- Chages the value of a table member in time according to specified args.

--- @param tableId table -- Id of the table
--- @param memberName string -- Name of the member
--- @param newValue number -- New value
--- @param type string -- Transition type
--- @param length number -- Transition length
--- ### Example

---     	DebugPrint(t.score)
--- 	end
--- end
--- ```
function SetValueInTable(tableId, memberName, newValue, type, length) end

--- Calling this function will add a button on the bottom bar or in the main pause menu (center of the screen) when the game is paused.
--- Identified by 'location' parameter, it can be below "Main menu" button (by passing "main_bottom" value)or above (by passing "main_top").
--- A primary button will be placed in the main pause menu if this function is called from a playable mod. There can be only one primary button.
--- Use this as a way to bring up mod settings or other user interfaces while the game is running.
--- Call this function every frame from the tick function for as long as the pause menu button
--- should still be visible.
--- Only one button per script is allowed. Consecutive calls replace button added in previous calls.
--- @param title string -- Text on button
--- @param location? string -- Button location. If "bottom_bar" - bottom bar, if "main_bottom" - below "Main menu" button, if "main_top" - above "Main menu" button. Default "bottom_bar".
--- @param disabled? bool -- Disable button. Button will be rendered as grayed out. Default is false. Only available when used with "bottom_bar".
--- @return boolean clicked -- True if clicked, false otherwise
--- ### Example
--- ```lua
--- function server.startLevel(mission, path)
--- 	StartLevel(mission, path)
--- end
--- function server.respawnPlayer(player)
--- 	-- Respawn player
--- end
--- function client.tick()
--- 	for p in Players() do
--- 		if IsPlayerHost(p) then
--- 			-- Primary button which will be placed in the main pause menu below "Main menu" button
--- 			if PauseMenuButton("Back to Hub", "main_bottom") then
--- 				ServerCall("server.startLevel", "hub", "level/hub.xml")	
--- 			end
--- 			-- Primary button which will be placed in the main pause menu above "Main menu" button
--- 			if PauseMenuButton("Back to Hub", "main_top") then
--- 				ServerCall("server.startLevel", "hub", "level/hub.xml")
--- 			end
--- 			-- Button will be placed in the bottom bar of the pause menu
--- 			if PauseMenuButton("MyMod Settings") then
--- 				visible = true
--- 			end
--- 		else
--- 			if PauseMenuButton("Respawn (wait 8s)", "bottom_bar", true) then
--- 				ServerCall("server.respawnPlayer", p)
--- 			end
--- 		end
--- 	end
--- end
--- function draw()
--- 	if visible then
--- 		UiMakeInteractive()
--- 	end
--- end
--- ```
function PauseMenuButton(title, location, disabled) end

--- 	StartLevel("level1", "MOD/level1.xml", "vehicles targets")
--- end
--- ```
function StartLevel(mission, path, layers, passThrough) end

--- Set paused state of the game
--- @param paused boolean -- True if game should be paused
--- ### Example
