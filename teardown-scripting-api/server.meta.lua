--- Each script has the following server callback functions that will be called by the game engine. Note that all of them are optional. In many cases, you will only need the init and tick. Most of the game logic should be implemented on the server. 
--- @class server
--- @field init? fun() -- Called once at load time
--- @field tick? fun(dt:number) -- Called exactly once per frame. The time step is variable but always between 0.0 and 0.0333333
--- @field update? fun(dt:number) -- Called at a fixed update rate, but at the most two times per frame. Time step is always 0.0166667 (60 updates per second). Depending on frame rate it might not be called at all for a particular frame.
--- @field postUpdate? fun() -- Called like update, but after physics. Because update can trigger physics updates, it can be necessary to do some additional calculations afterwards.
--- @field destroy? fun() -- For game mode scripts, this is called when the game mode is stopped

--- @type server
