--- Set joint motor target velocity. If joint is of type hinge, velocity is
--- given in radians per second angular velocity. If joint type is prismatic joint
--- velocity is given in meters per second. Calling this function will override and
--- void any previous call to SetJointMotorTarget.
--- @param joint number -- Joint handle
--- @param velocity number -- Desired velocity
--- @param strength? number -- Desired strength. Default is infinite. Zero to disable.
--- ### Example
--- ```lua
--- function server.init()
--- 	--Set motor speed to 0.5 radians per second

--- end
--- ```
--- [View Documentation](https://teardowngame.com/experimental/api.html#SetJointMotor)
function SetJointMotor(joint, velocity, strength) end

--- If a joint has a motor target, it will try to maintain its relative movement. This
--- is very useful for elevators or other animated, jointed mechanisms.
--- If joint is of type hinge, target is an angle in degrees (-180 to 180) and velocity
--- is given in radians per second. If joint type is prismatic, target is given
--- in meters and velocity is given in meters per second. Setting a motor target will
--- override any previous call to SetJointMotor.
--- @param joint number -- Joint handle
--- @param target number -- Desired movement target
--- @param maxVel? number -- Maximum velocity to reach target. Default is infinite.
--- @param strength? number -- Desired strength. Default is infinite. Zero to disable.
--- ### Example
--- ```lua
--- function server.init()
--- 	--Make joint reach a 45 degree angle, going at a maximum of 3 radians per second
--- 	SetJointMotorTarget(FindJoint("hinge"), 45, 3)
--- end
--- ```

--- depending on joint type.

function GetJointMovement(joint) end

--- @param body number -- Body handle (must be dynamic)
--- @return table bodies -- Handles to all dynamic bodies in the jointed structure. The input handle will also be included.
